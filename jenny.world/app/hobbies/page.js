          <p>I started writing for myself when I was 16 years old and find it essential to my creativity and wellbeing. Putting experiences into words is not only fun and cathartic but also helps hone my sensibility for narrative and meaning, which is key to my design work. Entries marked with a little heart (<span style={{padding: '0 2px'}}>‚ô•Ô∏è</span>) are personal favorites. Some are password-protected (üîí) for trusted readers only.</p>
          <p>I may post new writing on a delayed schedule‚Äîsome entries can hold tender, personal ideas, so I give myself time to move through the vulnerability of sharing online. I‚Äôm also still gathering past writings to retroactively populate various sections. <a href="#why">Why do I share my writing?</a></p>

          <p>I wrote about floundering around in Los Angeles mostly, but also other places like New Orleans and Mexico. These entries are kind of shameless. I wanted to be an artist, a designer, a journalist, a founder, a writer. Odd observations and ambitions missing consummation. Disorder, novelty, and general young adulthood panic. But also the beginnings of discovering my voice.</p>
          <p>You can witness the origins of my ornate writing style in these pieces, which I have tried to temper a bit over time.</p>

          <p>I believe telling personal stories is crucial for revealing the diversity of perspectives in the human experience. I‚Äôm a young Chinese-American woman with a humble upbringing as a daughter of a blended family of Asian immigrants. Simultaneously, I have the privilege today to be independent, have a safe home, pursue career projects I‚Äôm passionate about, and travel. As someone who didn‚Äôt grow up around narratives of people like me, with my specific backgrounds, cultural straddlings, and mix of idiosyncrasies and interests, I find it important to share my voice as an example of what‚Äôs possible.</p>
          <p>My writing can be vulnerable. I explore my emotional states, learnings, and observations about my life. Because I harbor a unique mix of identities‚Äîliterate and able-bodied, but also a second-generation and neurodivergent woman of color‚Äîthe way I occupy and perceive spaces is unique. Writing is my medium for making sense of and showing this experience firsthand.</p>
          <p>When others read my writing, I hope they can find what‚Äôs kindred between us. In turn, I hope this contributes to a larger project: giving people more tools to be empathetic and patient with one another.</p>
