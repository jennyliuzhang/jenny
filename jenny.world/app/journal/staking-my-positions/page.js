          reflect on 4am waking up for calls for school
          racoon:Today on the freeway, I saw a raccoon 4 lanes through a 6-lane stretch. He or she had two more lanes to go. It was perched on its hind legs with its arms in the air, and it looked terrified. It looked like it would want to move when the light of a car would begin its glow, but stopped short and shivered backward when the car would zip by.

I thought: wow, there’s really nothing for humans to do about this besides totally destroy our car ecosystem. This is a terrible flaw. Then I thought: actually, the thing I could do to interfere is to drive around and get back to this stretch of the highway, drive slow in the lane I think he was in, and wait until I confront the raccoon and just stop in the middle of the lane with my hazards on, so I block all incoming traffic until the raccoon passed.

I didn’t do this even though I had this thought, but it was definitely the virtuous thing to have done. If I were an excellent human, with excellent mastery of my agency in this world and our society, that’s what I would do. That seems like the right solution, and the humane and whole path.

Unfortunately, my lack of excellent agency led me to drive past, and similarly breeze past my considerations about the raccoon in just a few moments. I didn’t let myself feel the guilt too much, and I didn’t let myself dwell on the idea much longer. I was not acting excellently, I was acting dully.

When all human beings are mediocre in this way, when they don’t have the capacity or intentional consideration for virtue, they lead to consequences like this, where other beings, including other humans, can get caught in a loop of meaninglessness. I don’t know if that raccoon made it out alive tonight, and it is extremely sad and pathetic how whether it did or did not, it might not have an effect on the lives of other future and present raccoons, because they will also be subject to the same miserable circumstances. Life and death are governed by the bad design patterns of humans — in this case, the fact that cars are terribly overrated yet still run most of the USA — and it leads to cycles and generations of endless pain, challenge, and stress for raccoons, and every other forgotten subject of our matter and antimatter.

Then later this evening, I killed a house centipede in a depressing way: I turned on the light and saw one scurry across in front of my feet to shelter by my bookshelf. It was trying to find a crevice to hide, a place that was safe. But I did a damned thing and sprayed its entire area with peppermint spray. With every spray, its scurries slowed and twitched and faltered. I felt too sad and too bad that I couldn’t watch it longer and I stepped on it when it got slow enough for me to accurately step on it. I leaned in my body weight and thought a prayer. I picked it up with some bath tissue and flushed it.

Again, whether I killed it or let it keep living may not have mattered at all. If I left it alone, it would have probably been more virtuous of me. But its existence might have been dreadful. I don’t know if house centipedes are happy tenants in my home. I don’t know anything at all.

          I’m going to spend the next ten years digging through the literature, staking my positions, unearthing philosophical traditions and epistemologies that startle me, raising them back up to the ground to the realm of the sciences and psychology, gesture toward intuitions in this soil, research my hypotheses, and reach just conclusions about the narrative capacities of humans. I will argue for the deep truths and the reality of our needs in an aspiring technomoral society, and write many pieces to communicate these bits of wisdom to the masses. These will touch the philosophy of technology and the ethics of computing, as well as comment on design practices, creative expression, and the state of education. I will aggregate all of these curiosities and tested arguments into my augmented reality interfaces. The rhetoric of my technological and social vision will drive digital innovation, producing tools that will change the world. I will embark on operating one of the most elegant, efficient, nurturing, and healthy tech organizations on this planet, attracting some of the kindest, wisest, and whip-smart people alive.

I am Jenny, and though I am currently 26 and chaotic, I plan to be in my 40s one day with a deep security in who I am and manifesting onto planet Earth what I have always expected to, since I was a child. I am level-headed, funny, joyful, and wise.

I feel present with the people and motivations around me, and I feel at ease with aligning goals to action. I feel a deep gusto for my daily life, the mundane and the unique combined. I feel compassionate to who I have been at every age, even my nuisance years, and I feel happy to share and laugh about all my experiences.

I act and make decisions with confidence in how they align with my expected outcomes. I protect my time and that of my loved ones and collaborators, though I am nice about parting advice to people who aren’t so confident or aware of social limits yet. I do only the things that contribute to my goals within two degrees of separation — so if not directly, than only slightly indirectly — to ensure that everything I do is using my time in the most delicious and meaningful way.

I love my family, friends, and the life I get to live each day, even when my body feels funny or has stomachaches, even when my head feels groggy. I love walking, eating, resting, and laughing. I love to take care of the people closest to me, making them feel heard and seen and encouraging them to be the best selves they can. I love to be taken care of, too, by my loved ones and my community. I love sharing my voice and experiencing the resonance that others feel when they hear it, and inspiring them to share their voices too.

I speak my messages about love, human life, digital life, creation, and growth with targeted accuracy and brevity. I don’t elongate my messages unnecessarily: I speak to inform as many people as possible, conveying what I understand to be complex ideas in the most elegant way I can. I strive to pare down complex ideas before I speak, and only speak when the rhetoric feels logical and natural. I speak the truth about myself, owning up to my mistakes or oversights, but I also speak the truth about situations at hand, including others’ direct or indirect misjudgments, wrongdoings, or offenses. I speak with a command on language: I communicate with sternness when a topic is serious and challenging, and admonishment when discomfort is caused by transgressing social or personal limits. I take a moment to identify what the transgressions are, what needs are not being met, and what possible solutions or avenues of healing could be, all before I speak, or as much as possible before I speak. I understand these may all be evolved through conversation with other people, but I give myself the patient beat to analyze a situation before I speak about it. I am kind with my words and expressive of my emotions. I let my heart guide my message and use my brain to assign the best language units, or other mediums, to communicate it. I speak with firmness, confidence, and authenticity, and people know to trust what I say.

I see a joyful life with lots of hard work ahead. I see leveraging my digital tools efficiently to get all my projects done in a timely fashion, and I see mundane yet scrumptious activities — chores, money management, moving furniture, stretching — interspersed between the vision building. I see myself learning physical attunement again and accessing the infrequently visited tendrils of my body. I see love, breaking down projections and anxious self-narratives, and good food and fun, full days. I see bright colors in nature, beautiful homes, the smiles of people I love, conference rooms, clothing that fits my body just right and feels comfortable to wear all day, and road trips with my team. I see many teams, and I see myself being central to all of them. I see my posture improving and personal growth. I see getting into a dream university, with accolades and without funding issues.

I understand that time is a resource to be enjoyed, and that my body is the frontier of that adventure. I understand that I need to be patient with myself and my environment, so I can time my actions to their milieu and execute on my ambitions with blessed and deliberate timing. I understand that I need to be consistent with my material care, including physical self-care, wealth management, and relationship care. I understand that I’m on a journey to find my best routine for these activities, in balance with achieving my loftier humanitarian dreams, and that I will do all of it, it’s a matter of patience, timing, and artful use of energy. I understand that I am still governed by anxious and faulty self-narratives, and maybe these will evolve and maybe they won’t, but I need to keep them in check as I indulge my time every day, because they do have the ability to overtake me in some moments. I understand that I am in full control of what I choose, and that life is a multidimensional tapestry of nested realities that I can lean in and out of at will. I understand that I will always be the same even as I change because I’m the witness to this story and not an incidental character, and I am excited for how the whole work comes together in this lifetime and beyond. I understand that love is the governing force of the reality I want to live in, so I will keep tuning into it in my body and heart for as long as I’m on this planet. I understand that it’s my job to share this with as many others as I can, too. 

“Every word is a hypothesis and a test—while recognizing fearfully that with even the most casual remark we are building ourselves and our world irrevocably.” - nathan schneider

I had this moment of doubt today that I’m going down the wrong hole by pursuing academia and reading all of this about the philosophy of narrative, technology, and computing, and that building the tools of my dreams have nothing to do with any of this, and I could literally try starting the creative process now. However, after some brief reflection, literally like 30 minutes, I realized that it’s a choice to limit myself in this way: of course I could build something today right now, but the quality of it will change and be shaped by the particular process I follow, which will be tinted by the stubbornness and types of processes I inhabit today, as well as the people I decide to engage with as I conceptualize and test the work. Meanwhile, if I go down these philosophical paths and really unearth a deep understanding of knowledge traditions and how they can be contextualized today, I’ll have awakened a new cognitive and spiritual path for myself and my personal epistemologies, and because the tools I want to create are all about perception, I’ll have accessed a new part of me that will inform the tools I make, if not directly expressed, than indirectly in the tacit wisdom that comes with such exploration. This wisdom will inform my decision making and make me a more conscientious and thoughtful creator in some way, though that particular way won’t become apparent to me until I reach that point.In this way, I shouldn’t lose hope that what I create will be dislodged and estranged from my philosophical interests today. Though steps in the process may seem like that, if there’s anything I’ve learned while creating Plot Twisters, it’s that the creative intuitions always come back and manifest in even more crystal forms than when they were first revealed. The energy, when it’s coming from the right and same and consistent place, will always have the same qualities, and it will pick up whatever nuances it gathers from the contexts it’s funneled through.At the very least, Jenny, you should expect that your ultimate tools will be very thought out, attuned to the abstract, and deeply humanist, because that is where you are letting your energy travel now. It will pick up what it loves in these spaces now, and down the line, those curiosities will reappear in new forms and find themselves reflected in any future creations.Don’t worry so much, and don’t doubt yourself. &nbsp;&#x273d;</p>
