        <p>Dear Landon,</p>

        <p>I’m officially settled into Cleveland and living my homeowner life. I pay an HOA and am a regular patron at my local cafes. I think Ben visited prematurely in the spring to be honest — it was obviously fun, but I didn’t know the city as I do now. Now, I have favorite and less favorite haunts, I know the highways, I’ve tried more restaurants. I feel more connected to my neighborhood, which is very cute, historic, and walkable. I live in a building that used to be a 1920s saloon. My unit is the perfect size for my indoor shenanigans.</p>

        <p>Throughout the last year I had been dating someone I met in the UK. We tried long distance, but ultimately called it quits at the end of this summer. I really liked him but it was just not working—the death knoll came when feelings of scarcity around time and energy begin to foreground. In the last two months I started seeing a guy I play soccer with (which, by the way, I have been playing often and improving at), but we just ended it too because he moved out of the state. No super confident feelings of long-lasting love in the last couple years, but I'm surely learning a lot more about my tendencies and expectations in relationships, including how I personally I can take things and how impatient I can be.</p>

        <p>I’ve been making more local friends and even have some close friends too. My soccer teammates, people I’ve met at bars, friends from a social club I joined. That’s been very positive because the first few months I was here I felt quite alone. I’ve explored the music scene and various bars and clubs and had a good Halloween. I dressed up as an angel one night and the next as “Holy Guacamole:” I combined an avocado onesie with the halo from my angel costume.</p>

        <p>I’m grateful for my social life, but my time management is gettinga a bit out of balance. My Masters degree is ongoing, so I have paper deadlines often. I’m taking a class about the ethics of autonomous systems, another about narrative and computational text analysis, and a third about algorithmic text-based storytelling. My full-time job at Dorsia is hectic, but I'm learning a lot and got some new teammates who I love and look up to. Plot Twisters is relegated to my weekends as a part-time commitment for our team. We won an IDEO grant of $50K to give us a little resource boost, but we haven’t really used the funds since we’re still in R&D. Despite the quietness of the project, we are consistent and making progress. Y2K is on our team and I love it. I’m really proud and protective of the work and thinking underlying it. I’m trusting the process and in no rush, remembering that many games took ages to build and also had windy origin stories!</p>

        <p>I have a bob haircut and a few more tattoos on my arm of flowers. Otherwise, I think I look exactly the same. Maybe more athletic because of soccer. I’d like to tell you that I’m cooking for myself more, but the truth is that I’m eating out really often. Probably more than I ever have. I’ve realized I don’t /love/ cooking. I love food I make, but I don’t like the process very much. As such, I make myself the bare minimums — salads, slow cooked broths, rice and sardines, eggs for breakfast — but I’m often on an eating out + leftovers diet. I don’t have dietary restrictions right now, though when I was dating UK guy I was vegetarian.</p>

        <p>I’ve been reading for my Masters, but nothing very striking. Outside of school I started reading a philosophy book my neighbor lent me called Hyperculture by Byung Chul Han. the vibes are critical analysis of capitalism and the bastardization of modern labor. I’ve tried to read more about the US midwest now that I’m here, and have been wading through a book called “Midwest Futures,” thinking about how Cleveland can be a “strong town.” I also started reading a biography of the prophet Muhammad by Martin Lings because the soccer player I was dating is muslim and I was learning more about islam from him. It’s been very interesting to read stories about the piousness of past people, and how that piety infused everything that they did and thought about. Since college I’ve basically understood that a … directionality to life/form/growth exists, but noncommittal to doctrines about this directionality. I’m seeing more and more the benefit of why following a religion is helpful. but the articulation of my own virtues are still percolating</p>

        <p>lastly, I have gotten more into feng shui and interior design. I really love parisian and british townhouse interior design. I am very into https://www.houseandgarden.co.uk/ right now. Most of my design skills are visual, and while this applies to interior design, the spatial element is very new to me. but I’m getting the hang of it. I actually hired an interior designer to help me plan my space since it’s very angular and oblong and strange. I’m feeling more and more comfortable in my home as a result. but my house is under ongoing renovation (new blinds, new paint, etc.) and so despite being in a stable location, life remains turbulent !!</p>

        <p>I see the early years of Plot Twisters — freelancing, traveling, Dorsia, figuring out things, being stressed, balancing a lot, sometimes for no reason, working hard, working too hard, getting angry, getting frustrated — as the prelude. It was the first period of life experiences solely about the creative process. I was realizing things about how creativity work, and earning some of the key themes of creativity I still hold very dear: emotion. Interpersonal relationship management. Magic of intuition, experience, insight, the moment.

        I had a lot of great adventures during this time, as well as a lot of lows. Terrible frustrations with people, taking others’ put downs too personally, fights with my parents. It was a whole lot, but I learned a lot about my own personal strengths: I am a cerebral person, I am thoughtful, I am artistic.

        A lot of this period was balancing the expression of my creative instincts in my hobbies and Plot Twisters, while trying to be a professional in my freelance life, which I’m sure people saw straight through. It was obvious I was very green in my career. But to whatever extent I added value I stayed in my positions, and at Dorsia I was valued enough as a thoughtful contributor and executor that I stayed on for several years.

        The turning point into the first chapter, for me, was then when I moved to Cleveland. I had decided to settle down for a bit. I wanted  a home base after trying to get my shit together while flitting around. Or so I thought a home base would help me get my shit together more efficiently, faster. It did, but after many cycles of practice, of time.

        I call this time a lost chapter, because I was not doing any sort of digital documentation. I was just busy and living. Playing soccer. Trying to manage my house. Taking care of business. Doing my taxes. Working my hours. Writing for school. All the little tasks that keep a bureaucratic and productive life together. I was administrative and more stringent.

        But growing in this executive capacity is not a linear process by any means. I was still carrying weights from my earlier experiences. I was still emotional, sensitive, pathological. Cerebral to a fault at times. It was a time where I was learning to be a young professional at work and still coming into awareness about the distribution of accountabilities in adult-world, and the power dynamics at play, including the invisible ones.

        And when I first got to Cleveland I was very lonely. But I focused on balancing the things in my life. I sought to take my goals seriously, to stop funneling so much emotional energy into activities — like my day jobs — that were not going to care for me emotionally in return. I made peace with the activities I found fulfilling. Of course, this happened in phases and I would often swing back and forth between full “fuck ‘em” “fuck it” mentality where I would take nothing in that life seriously and taking everything seriously and being confused and seeing reassurance from coworkers about scenarios were directives were vague.

        This is my first chapter because I began to reveal more to myself about all I knew about creativity. I got more vivid insight and ability to articulate it.

        The struggles of this period, as the wonderfully necessary solo reflections of this period, taught me a lot about how the quality of relationships impact the quality of creations, and that almost all birth of creative insight relies on the interpretation and moralization of the cohabitants in the time and space of its release. That’s an extremely heady way of saying that nothing is really ever true or false or black or white, but it’s always about what is productive and healthy and meaningful in context. That is the right path to success.

        I had to learn to get out of my own paradigms. The way I do things is not always the right way; there are other ways to do things. But also, sometimes the way I do things is right and good and productive. Negotiating the perspectives of both is an ongoing dance that happens in every situation, and peace is found through the interpersonal communication of such.

        I wanted to talk about why my Masters thesis = “Technologist as author” but I’m getting a bit tired now. Tomorrow.
